    I didnt had to go through all code lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I can commit when things are done;
		  I can chose whenever someone else can see my job and avoid misunderstendings in my work.
	Cons: Something can get lost;
		  I have to remember to meake commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files might be parts of one project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Im not afride that something will get lost
