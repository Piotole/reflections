When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

if im working remotly, or if i want to easly show my code to someone


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

i might work on an older version of a project and pulling something that i dont know about might interrupt my work
